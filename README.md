```

#### Getting a token
The tool makes use of Log4Shell tokens from [Canary Tokens](https://canarytokens.org). The tool has capability to automatically generate tokens, if the values of the token (`--token`) and server (`--server`) are empty.

Once the token is generated, the token and the auth value are written to a file called `canary-token.json`.

#### Targets specification
You can specify the targets in two modes:
- Scan a single URL:
  ```
  ./log4jhunt.py -u 1.2.3.4:8080 ...
  ```
- Use a file to specify a list of targets:
  ```
  ./log4jhunt.py -f targets.txt ...
  ```

#### Specifying notification channels
There are two ways in which you can receive notification channels:
- email (`--email`) -- service provided by Canarytokens.
- webhook (`--webhook`) -- service provided by Canarytokens.
- custom server (`--server`) -- you own custom DNS callback server.

Once the tool finds a vulnerable server, notifications would be relayed back to your preferred communication channel.

#### Sending requests
- You can customize the HTTP methods using `--methods`.
- A custom set of HTTP headers can be specified via `--headers` respectively.
- A custom user agent can be specified using `--user-agent` header.
- You can specfy a custom timeout value using `--timeout`.
- You can specify custom proxies to use in HTTP requests via `--proxy`.

#### Specifying delay

Since a lot of HTTP requests are involved, it might be a cumbersome job for the remote host to handle the requests. The `--delay` parameter is here to help you with those cases. You can specify a delay value in seconds -- which will be used be used in between two subsequent requests to the same port on a server.
